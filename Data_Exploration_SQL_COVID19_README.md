This project focuses on exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL queries. The dataset includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population across various countries and continents.

Questions I answered in this project include:
What is the likelihood of dying if a person contracted the virus in their country?
What percentage got Covid?
What countries have the highest infection rate compared to total population?
What continents had the highest deaths, and How many people in a country were vaccinated?


1. Selecting Relevant Data
The project begins by selecting pertinent data from the CovidDeaths table, focusing on essential metrics such as total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population.

2. Likelihood of Dying
Analyzing the likelihood of dying if contracting COVID-19 in specific countries by calculating the death percentage.

3. Population Infection Percentage
Examining the percentage of population infected in specific countries.

4. Continent-wise Analysis
Analyzing death counts by continent and identifying continents with the highest death counts.

5. Vaccination Analysis
Examining vaccination data and creating a view for later visualizations.

This SQL-based data exploration provides comprehensive insights into COVID-19 trends, death rates, infection percentages, and vaccination coverage. The project includes a variety of queries for detailed analysis and visualization, offering a holistic view of the global pandemic landscape.
